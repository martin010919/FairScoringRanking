A way to fairly rank data set entries based

# MyAnimeList Fair Ranking System

## Overview
This ranking system is designed to provide fair and balanced anime rankings while accounting for various factors including number of ratings, score distribution, and "plan to watch" (PTW) status uncertainty. The system aims to balance raw scores with popularity while preventing manipulation and accounting for statistical confidence.

## Key Components

### Base Scoring Parameters
- Minimum ratings threshold: 100 ratings required for baseline confidence
- Bayesian prior: 7.0 (global mean score across MAL)
- Prior weight: 500 (equivalent to 500 ratings worth of influence)

### Confidence Calculation
- Starts at 100 minimum ratings
- Confidence increases linearly with number of ratings
- Maximum confidence (1.0) achieved when ratings exceed minimum threshold
- Confidence is adjusted down based on estimated PTW ratio

### Plan to Watch (PTW) Adjustments
- Estimates PTW ratio based on mean score
- Maximum PTW ratio: 50% for top-rated shows
- PTW estimation formula: (mean_score / 10) * 0.5
- Affects confidence calculation and popularity metrics
- Higher-rated shows assumed to have higher PTW ratios

### Popularity Bonus
- Logarithmic bonus based on total ratings: log10(adjusted_total + 1) * 0.08
- Considers both actual ratings and estimated PTW entries
- Diminishing returns prevent extremely popular shows from dominating
- Adjusted based on popularity rank within the dataset

### Completion Bonus
- Rewards shows that convert PTW to actual ratings
- Calculated as: log10(total_ratings / (popularity_rank + 1)) * 0.05
- Helps identify shows that viewers actually complete
- Counterbalances potential PTW inflation

## Score Calculation Process

1. **Initial Confidence**
   - Calculate base confidence using actual ratings
   - Adjust confidence based on estimated PTW ratio

2. **Popularity Adjustment**
   - Apply logarithmic popularity bonus
   - Consider both actual ratings and estimated PTW

3. **Bayesian Estimation**
   - Combine prior score with actual ratings
   - Weight based on number of ratings and confidence

4. **Completion Consideration**
   - Add completion bonus based on popularity rank
   - Reward shows with high completion rates

5. **Final Score**
   - Combine all factors into final score
   - Ensure result stays within 1-10 range

## Benefits

1. **Manipulation Resistance**
   - Requires significant number of ratings to achieve full confidence
   - Bayesian prior prevents extreme scores with low ratings
   - Balanced approach to popularity prevents vote bombing

2. **Fair to Different Types of Shows**
   - Accounts for inherent popularity differences
   - Considers both absolute ratings and relative performance
   - Balances between niche appeal and mass popularity

3. **Statistical Robustness**
   - Accounts for sample size uncertainty
   - Handles unknown PTW counts
   - Uses confidence-based weighting

4. **Transparency**
   - Clear ranking factors
   - Explainable adjustments
   - Traceable ranking changes

## Ranking Impacts

### Positive Factors
- High mean scores
- Large number of ratings
- Strong completion rates
- Consistent performance across larger audiences

## Usage Considerations

1. **Parameter Tuning**
   - Minimum ratings threshold can be adjusted based on platform size
   - PTW ratio estimation can be calibrated with actual platform data
   - Bonus weights can be modified to adjust factor importance

2. **Implementation Notes**
   - Regular recalculation recommended as ratings accumulate
   - Consider caching intermediate calculations for performance
   - Monitor for unexpected ranking behaviors with edge cases

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Could incorporate rating distribution analysis
   - Might add seasonal normalization
   - Could include genre-specific adjustments
   - Potential for user reliability weighting
